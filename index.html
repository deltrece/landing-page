        <h2>F.E.N.D. Journey</h2>
        <p>For as long as I can remember, I have always had the love for tech “toys”, gadgets and cool websites, such as
          <em>MySpace</em>. I know I know, MySpace may not be a cool website these days, but that sparked my interest in
          web design and development. Having previously built websites using templates with drag and drop methods,
          functionality, design and analytics are limited and I did not know how to make adjustments to code. I
          discovered this <strong>Udacity Front End Web Developer</strong> program where <b>One Ten</b> was offering
          scholarships to individuals who applied on their website. I applied and was granted a scholarship in October
          of 2022 and April of 2023 the program will end.
        </p>

        <p>The goal of the program is to equip learners with unique skills needed to build and develop a variety of
          websites and applications. In addition to the technical learning, problem solving, collaboration and resources
          was gained through the community that was formed throughout the program. </p>

    <section id="section2" data-nav="BLOG">
      <div class="landing__container">
        <h2>Blog Project</h2>
        <p>The second project required building a <b>BLOG</b> site with no starter code provided and use Hyper Text
          Markup
          Language, Cascading Style Sheets and Assets folders. Blog posts, images and buttons &amp; items were required
          and standout features were optional. I deployed my project to my domain and also connected Google Analytics
          and Facebook Pixel which are codes provided that would be included in the header of every page. I also
          included widgets and from Google Calendar & Eventbrite. Easy Peasy! </p>

        <p>The most challenging part of that project was getting started. Decision paralysis is real and I could not
          decide on the design and style I wanted to showcase. Once I began inputting code in my code editor, VS Code,
          it was up and running then. Using the live server view and the inspect tools were crucial in the design phase,
          in
          addition to finding typos too! I always seem to spot them after I push send a commit message in Github.</p>

    <section id="section3" data-nav="SHOP">
      <div class="landing__container">
        <h2>Shopping Cart</h2>
        <p>The third project introduced the <em>Javascript</em> language to build a Shopping Cart website. Starter code,
          content
          and structure was provided and the project taught students how to turn a static website into an interactive
          one. A simple website at minimum is built with HTML, CSS &amp; Javascript. There are many other languages for
          website development and knowing Javascript is great for a beginner to know to create fun and dynamic websites.
        </p>

        <p>The most challenging part of learning Javascript to me is the terminology. Therefore relying heavily on
          additional resources and others with greater knowledge is essential for growth for a new web developer.
          Completing this project during the program formed and strengthened the connection for many of us new learners
          as we began to come together to collaborate and share resources. One of my favorite quotes is the African
          Proverb: &quot;If you want to go fast, go alone, but if you want to go far, go together &quot;</p>

      <div class="landing__container">
        <h2>Landing Page: Final Project</h2>
        <p>The final project of this program includes this <b>Landing Page</b> site you&apos;re currently browsing.
          Minimal starter code was provided by <b>Udacity</b> and this project relies primarily on manipulating the
          <em>Document Object Model</em> to modify the website contents dynamically. Learning how to use the Chrome
          developer tools to inspect and debug during the building process is imperative for Front End Website
          Developers. As well as having stable wi-fi and electricity, but that&apos;s a blog post for another day, on my
          site of course! P.S. Don&apos;t forget to visit it if you haven&apos;t yet, just look for my name below
          ;-&rpar;</p>

        <p>This project was as equally challenging as the previous ones, however I enjoyed discovering the plethora of
          tools and features that&apos;s available in the Chrome tools that&apos;s more than the Console. Reading and
          writing README.md files on Github and the power of community and connections as I continue on this <em>Front
            End Web Development</em> journey.</p>
